# Suggested Improvements for the Codebase

1. Retry mechanism:
   1.1 Convert Queue.Dequeue to an async method to support retry logic for message processing.
   1.2 Queue.Dequeue should return a special retry message when
       there is still message to process but the message key is still being processed by another worker,
        indicating that the worker should retry the operation after a short delay.
        
Benefits of this approach:
- Prevents premature worker termination when messages are still available but temporarily locked
- Ensures more balanced workload distribution among workers
- Reduces unnecessary worker churn and resource waste
- Improves overall system efficiency by allowing workers to wait for locked resources instead of exiting


2.Logging System
   2.1  Implement worker monitoring to detect premature worker termination and identify potential issues with the Dequeue function.

Benefits of this approach:
- Provides Icrease observability into worker performance.
- Enables proactive detection of worker issues and bottlenecks

3. Worker System
   3.1 Implement dynamic worker scaling to automatically spawn new workers when there are pending messages and existing workers have terminated

Benefits of this approach:
- Maintain optimal worker count to prevent overloading active workers by automatically scaling up when worker count falls below minimum requirements
